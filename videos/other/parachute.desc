But I'm not certain that I did the animation of the parachute. The
parachute is definitely my parachute but the llizard is slightly
different from mine. I think maybe Veronica Karlsson did that animation.
I'll just check dejanews.

Aha! Regardez.

So there it is. For the parachute animation the credits should read as
follows: ascii-art by llizard, Erik K. Veland and Veronica Karlsson and
animation by Veronica Karlsson.

Phew. I hate to be given credit for something I didn't do.
